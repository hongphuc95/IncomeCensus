# Income Census Analysis

## Abstract
In this project report we have a summary of our analysis and exploration of the Adult Census Data to come up with meaningful, important and interesting attributes of the data. Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes we have performed a predictive task of classification, whether income exceeds $50K/yr. based on this data.


## Goal
The goal of this project is to explore the US Adult Income data and develop a model to predict whether an individual's income will be less than or equal to $50,000, or greater than $50,000. This prediction will be based on a number of features that describe the data.

Initially, we will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the integrity of the data and decide how issues with missing or unclear data will be handled. We will also present some summary statistics via visualizations.

We will then perform a more focused analysis which includes a series of visualizations and tables that serve to answer the following research questions:

- Given a set of features, can we predict whether the income of a person will be greater than or less than $50,000?
- Which feature is the most important in determining income classification?
- Ignoring income, what factors appear to be highly correlated with each other?

In conclusion, we will reflect on the implication of the findings from this analysis. We will also reflect on any limitations that may be reflected in the data.
